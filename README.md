# Baby Games API
#### Capstone Project for Epicodus, 10.05.17
_**By Max Scher**_

## Description
This application is an API which accesses a database hosted at mLab.com.  The app generates a local server used to make said database available to API callers.  The app currently works in conjunction with the [Dad Helper](https://github.com/maxobaxo/dad-helper), which provides a React view-layer that powers the app's official GUI.

The API is built to process `GET`, `PUSH`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests, rounding out basic CRUD functionality.

## Setup/Installation
`cd ~/Desktop`  
`git clone https://github.com/maxobaxo/dad-helper-api`  
`cd dad-helper-api`  
`npm install`  
`npm run start`  

You should receive a message in the terminal that reads `Express server listening on port 3000`, which means the server is up and running and the API can now process requests.

## Technical Specifications
* It can successfully process `GET`, `PUSH`, `PUT`, and `DELETE` requests at each of the following URLs:
  * https://localhost/ages
  * https://localhost/skills
  * https://localhost/games

## Wishlist
* Expand the database at mLab.com to include a much larger set of data to work with.
